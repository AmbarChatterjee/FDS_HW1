1. **Image Filtering (9 points)**: Understanding and implementing 1D and 2D image filters.
2. **Multi-Scale Image Representations (9 points)**: Exploring various image representation techniques, including edge detection and template matching.
3. **Object Identification (12 points)**: Techniques and methods for object identification using color histograms and image retrieval.
4. **Bonus Question - Performance Evaluation (5 points)**: An optional section that focuses on evaluating the performance of the implemented methods.

## Submission Requirements
The homework should be submitted as a single Jupyter Notebook file (`HW1.ipynb`). Ensure that all code sections are complete and error-free, and all written responses are provided in Markdown format. The notebook should be detailed, with clear explanations of the methods used and the results obtained.
